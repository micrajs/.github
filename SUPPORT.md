## Using labels

To find issues that you are looking for, you can use [our labels](https://github.com/micrajs/community/labels) to filter down the list. The labels are categorized as:

- **[Priority](https://github.com/micrajs/community/labels?q=Priority):** These labels define the priority of a given issue. Each priority label is defined as `Priority: {level}`. E.g. `Priority: critical`.
- **[Project](https://github.com/micrajs/community/labels?q=Project):** These labels define which project the issue is associated with. This makes is easy for you to filter issues to those related to a given project. Each project label is defined as `Project: {name}`. E.g. `Project: developer-tools`.
- **[Stage](https://github.com/micrajs/community/labels?q=Stage):** These labels define the stage of a given project and will only be assigned to epics. Each stage label is defined as `Stage: {stage}`. E.g. `Stage: prototype`.
- **[Status](https://github.com/micrajs/community/labels?q=Status):** These labels define the status of a given issue. Each status label is defined as `Status: {status}`. E.g. `Status: in review`.
- **[Type](https://github.com/micrajs/community/labels?q=Type):** These labels define the type of a given issue. They follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) standards and gives insight into what type of work is expected from the issue. Each type label is defined as `Type: {type}`. E.g. `Type: feat`.
