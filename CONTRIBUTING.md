## From Contributor To Committer

We love contributions from our community! If you'd like to go beyond a contributor
and become a part of the core team with full write access and a say in the project, you must
be invited to the project. The existing team employ an internal nomination
process that must reach lazy consensus (silence is approval) before invitations
are issued. If you feel you are qualified and want to get more deeply involved,
feel free to reach out to existing committers to have a conversation about that.

## Security Issues

Security issues shouldn't be reported on this issue tracker. Instead, [file an issue to our security experts](mailto:contact@micra.dev)
